        <p>VetZuki was created out of frustration with the candidate screening process at companies. The time and energy required to interview candidates is expensive and time-consuming. Another factor was the emotional toll on the interviewer stuck with a candidate who is simply terrible yet deserves the same interview as other candidates.</p>
        <p>Creating a more humane and efficient process is possible and VetZuki is the way.</p>
